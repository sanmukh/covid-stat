A python script to check some stats on the virus. While there are excellent resources both more informative and more appealing than this script, I wanted something more personalized (to keep daily track of India and Califoria :-/). Please feel free to customize as you see fit.


The script relies on the dataset - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 and requires the following directory structure. COVID_DIR is defined inside covid.py and need to point to the top level directory of the dataset.

covid.py
COVID_DIR
├── covid.py
├── csse_covid_19_data
│   ├── csse_covid_19_time_series
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv
│   │   ├── time_series_19-covid-Deaths.csv
│   │   ├── time_series_19-covid-Recovered.csv
│   │   ├── time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
│   │   └── time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
│   └── README.md


You can obtain the dataset by running git clone https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19  

The script has been tested on python 3.6.10 and requires numpy


usage: covid.py [-h] [--plot PLOT] [--country COUNTRY] [--start START]
                [--end END] [--plottype PLOTTYPE] [--plotxkcd]

generate plots on COVID-19

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --plot PLOT          what to plot: all, new, t2d
  --country COUNTRY    country name as per the timeseries csv file
  --start START        offset of first entry to read starting from 1/22/20
  --end END            offset of last entry to read starting from 1/22/20
  --plottype PLOTTYPE  type of plot: bar, line
  --plotxkcd           plot xkcd style

Some quirks and bugs:
Does not support stats for entire US. US data in the dataset is provided at state and county level which needs additional effort to parse.
U.S. state level stats are supported with keywords such as - California, "New York" (quotes needed due to space), Washington,US (to differentiate from Washington,D.C.)
Some countrynames in the dataset have quotes, for example, "Korea, South". Such entries are not supported yet.
Its not thoroughly tested, so more bugs can be expected
