A python script to check some stats on the virus. While there are excellent resources both more informative and more appealing than this script, I wanted something more personalized (to keep daily track of India and US:-/). Please feel free to customize as you see fit.


The script relies on the dataset - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 and requires the following directory structure. COVID_DIR is defined inside covid.py and need to point to the top level directory of the dataset. Files marked as * are used by the script.

covid.py
COVID_DIR
├── covid.py
├── csse_covid_19_data
│   ├── csse_covid_19_time_series
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv
│   │   ├── time_series_19-covid-Deaths.csv
│   │   ├── time_series_19-covid-Recovered.csv
│   │   ├── time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv*
│   │   └── time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
│   └── README.md


You can obtain the dataset by running git clone https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19  

The script has been tested on python 3.6.10 on linux and requires numpy


usage: covid.py [-h] [--plot PLOT] [--country COUNTRY] [--start START]
                [--end END] [--plottype PLOTTYPE] [--plotxkcd]

generate plots on COVID-19

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --plot PLOT          what to plot: all, new, t2d
  --country COUNTRY    country name as per the timeseries csv file
  --start START        offset of first entry to read starting from 1/22/20
  --end END            offset of last entry to read starting from 1/22/20
  --plottype PLOTTYPE  type of plot: bar, line
  --plotxkcd           plot xkcd style

Some quirks and bugs:
Countries with spaces in their names need to be passed within quotes e.g. "Korea, South"
Its not thoroughly tested, so more bugs can be expected
